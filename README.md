# Resizive
## Responsible Responsive Resizing

An incredible tool that enables easier detection of content-based breakpoints for media queries in regards to responsively designed fluid-width websites. It allows incremental 'stepping' of the viewport width to discover when your website's content layout is failing, and can also animate between a minimum and maximum width to help visualize your design in real time. This allows you to discard outdated device sizes as your breakpoints for your media queries, and use the content itself as a guide, fulfilling a richer, better experience.
